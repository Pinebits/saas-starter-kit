# Change DaisyUI Theme

## Objective
Change the daisyUI theme in the SaaS Starter Kit application to use different theme(s) according to user preferences.

## Implementation Plan
1. **Modify the Tailwind Configuration File**
  - Dependencies: None
  - Notes: This is the primary step to change available themes
  - Files: `tailwind.config.js`
  - Status: Not Started

2. **Implement Theme Switching Functionality (Optional)**
  - Dependencies: Task 1
  - Notes: Only needed if dynamic theme switching is required
  - Files: New component files for theme switcher
  - Status: Not Started

3. **Test Theme Changes**
  - Dependencies: Tasks 1 and optionally 2
  - Notes: Verify visual appearance across different components
  - Files: N/A
  - Status: Not Started

## Verification Criteria
- The application correctly uses the newly configured theme(s)
- UI elements adopt the new theme's color palette and styling
- If implementing theme switching, the switch functionality works correctly
- Application maintains responsive design with the new theme

## Potential Risks and Mitigations
1. **Theme Incompatibility**  
   Mitigation: Review daisyUI documentation to ensure selected themes are compatible with the current version of daisyUI

2. **CSS Conflicts**  
   Mitigation: Check for any custom CSS that might override theme variables and adjust as needed

3. **Accessibility Issues**  
   Mitigation: Test the new theme for color contrast and accessibility compliance

## Alternative Approaches
1. **Custom Theme Creation**: Instead of using predefined daisyUI themes, create a custom theme that matches exact brand requirements
2. **CSS Variables Approach**: Use CSS variables for theming instead of relying solely on daisyUI themes

   - The first theme in the array is used as the default

3. **Custom Theme Configuration (Optional)**:
   - DaisyUI also supports custom themes using this format:
     ```js
     daisyui: {
       themes: [
         {
           mytheme: {
             "primary": "#your-color",
             "secondary": "#your-color",
             "accent": "#your-color",
             "neutral": "#your-color",
             "base-100": "#your-color",
             // Add other color values as needed
           },
         },
         "dark", // You can still include built-in themes
       ],
     },
     ```

4. **Rebuild the Application**:
   - After changing the configuration, rebuild the application to apply the new theme settings
