# Duplicate Pages Resolution

## Issue
The application had duplicate pages where both JavaScript (.js) and TypeScript (.tsx) files existed for the same routes. This caused the following error during startup:

```
âš  Duplicate page detected. pages\admin\index.js and pages\admin\index.tsx resolve to /admin
```

## Resolution
The following duplicate files were removed:

1. **pages\admin\index.js**
   - Reason: The TypeScript version (index.tsx) was more consistent with the application architecture
   - The .tsx version:
     - Imports the AdminDashboard component from the components directory
     - Uses AppLayout for consistent UI
     - Has proper TypeScript support
     - Uses serverSideTranslations for i18n
     - Has proper server-side authentication checks

2. **pages\admin\tenants\new.js**
   - Reason: The TypeScript version (new.tsx) was more consistent with the application architecture
   - The .tsx version:
     - Imports CreateTenantForm component
     - Uses AppLayout for consistent UI
     - Has proper TypeScript support
     - Uses serverSideTranslations for i18n
     - Has proper server-side authentication checks

## Retained Files
- **pages\admin\master-admins\index.js**
  - Reason: No TypeScript equivalent exists
  - Note: In a future update, this could be converted to TypeScript to maintain consistency

## Benefits
1. Eliminated duplicate route conflicts
2. Maintained consistent application architecture
3. Preserved TypeScript type safety
4. Kept server-side rendering and authentication mechanisms

## Best Practices
For future development:
1. Always use TypeScript (.tsx) files for React components
2. Follow the component-based architecture pattern
3. Use AppLayout for consistent UI
4. Implement server-side authentication checks
5. Use serverSideTranslations for i18n support
