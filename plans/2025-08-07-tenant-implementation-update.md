# Tenant Implementation Update

## Changes Implemented

1. Updated `pages/dashboard.tsx` to use the new tenant system:
   - Changed import from `useTeams` to `useTenants`
   - Updated all references to `teams` to `tenants` within the component
   - Updated redirection paths from `/teams/...` to `/tenants/...`
   - Updated the query parameter from `newTeam=true` to `newTenant=true`

## Results

These changes ensure that after a user logs in, they will be:

1. Redirected to the dashboard page
2. The dashboard page will fetch their available tenants
3. If the user has tenants, they'll be redirected to the first tenant's settings page
4. If the user has no tenants, they'll be redirected to the tenants page with a flag to create a new tenant

## Next Steps

While the core dashboard functionality has been updated to work with tenants, there are still some references to teams in various components that should be updated in a future iteration:

1. Many components in the `/components` directory still reference team APIs and routes
2. These should be systematically updated to use tenant endpoints and routes

## Testing

To test these changes:

1. Log in to the application
2. Verify you're correctly redirected to a tenant page if you have existing tenants
3. Verify you're directed to create a new tenant if you have no tenants

## Note

The environment configuration still redirects to `/dashboard` after authentication, which is correct as the dashboard now properly handles tenant redirection.
