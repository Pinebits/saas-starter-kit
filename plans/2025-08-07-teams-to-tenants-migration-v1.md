# Teams to Tenants Migration

## Objective
Transform the current Teams concept into a Tenants model to support full multi-tenancy, where individual users cannot administer which tenants they are part of. Only master administrators will have the ability to manage tenant membership.

## Implementation Plan

1. **Database Schema Modifications**
  - Dependencies: None
  - Notes: Schema changes need to be carefully executed with data migration strategy
  - Files: 
    - prisma/schema.prisma
    - migrations (auto-generated)
  - Status: Not Started

2. **Rename Team Model to Tenant**
  - Dependencies: Database Schema Modifications
  - Notes: This requires renaming the model and all related fields in the Prisma schema
  - Files:
    - prisma/schema.prisma
    - models/team.ts (to models/tenant.ts)
  - Status: Not Started

3. **Adjust TeamMember to TenantMember**
  - Dependencies: Database Schema Modifications
  - Notes: Update the model and relationships to reflect tenant membership
  - Files:
    - prisma/schema.prisma
    - models/teamMember.ts (to models/tenantMember.ts)
  - Status: Not Started

4. **Create Master Administrator Role and Permissions**
  - Dependencies: Database Schema Modifications
  - Notes: Add a new role that supersedes the current Owner/Admin roles for global management
  - Files:
    - prisma/schema.prisma (update Role enum)
    - lib/permissions (or similar auth files)
  - Status: Not Started

5. **Modify Tenant Member Management Logic**
  - Dependencies: Rename Team Model to Tenant, Adjust TeamMember to TenantMember
  - Notes: Remove self-service tenant management capabilities from regular users
  - Files:
    - models/tenant.ts
    - models/tenantMember.ts
    - API routes managing tenant membership
  - Status: Not Started

6. **Create Tenant Administration Dashboard for Master Admins**
  - Dependencies: Create Master Administrator Role and Permissions
  - Notes: Build new UI for centralized tenant management
  - Files:
    - pages/admin/tenants/* (new files)
    - components/admin/tenants/* (new files)
  - Status: Not Started

7. **Update API Routes**
  - Dependencies: Rename Team Model to Tenant
  - Notes: Refactor all team-related API endpoints to work with tenants
  - Files:
    - pages/api/* (all team-related endpoints)
  - Status: Not Started

8. **Modify Frontend Components**
  - Dependencies: Rename Team Model to Tenant
  - Notes: Update all UI components and pages to reflect tenant terminology
  - Files:
    - components/* (all team-related components)
    - pages/* (all team-related pages)
  - Status: Not Started

9. **Update Authentication Guards and Middleware**
  - Dependencies: Create Master Administrator Role and Permissions
  - Notes: Ensure proper access control for tenant-related operations
  - Files:
    - lib/guards/*.ts
    - middleware.ts (if exists)
  - Status: Not Started

10. **Update Utility Scripts**
  - Dependencies: Rename Team Model to Tenant
  - Notes: Modify scripts like delete-team.js to work with tenants
  - Files:
    - delete-team.js (to delete-tenant.js)
    - Other utility scripts
  - Status: Not Started

11. **Data Migration**
  - Dependencies: All schema changes
  - Notes: Create migration scripts to transform existing team data to tenant data
  - Files:
    - prisma/migrations/* (auto-generated)
    - scripts/migrate-teams-to-tenants.js (new file)
  - Status: Not Started

12. **Testing and Validation**
  - Dependencies: All previous tasks
  - Notes: Comprehensive testing of the new tenant system
  - Files: N/A
  - Status: Not Started

## Verification Criteria
- Existing teams are successfully migrated to tenants without data loss
- Only master administrators can add/remove users from tenants
- Regular users cannot modify their tenant membership
- All tenant-related operations work as expected
- SSO, API keys, billing, and other integrations continue to work with the tenant model
- User interface correctly reflects the tenant terminology
- Proper access control is enforced for tenant management

## Potential Risks and Mitigations

1. **Data Loss During Migration**
  - Mitigation: Create comprehensive backup before migration and perform test migrations in staging environment

2. **Breaking API Changes**
  - Mitigation: Implement API versioning or temporary compatibility layer for external integrations

3. **Disruption to Existing Users**
  - Mitigation: Communicate changes in advance and provide clear documentation on the new tenant model

4. **Schema Conflicts**
  - Mitigation: Carefully design the migration to handle potential conflicts, especially with custom fields or extensions

5. **Performance Impact**
  - Mitigation: Benchmark and optimize queries for the new tenant model, especially for large organizations

6. **Integration Issues with Third-party Services**
  - Mitigation: Test all integrations (SSO, billing, etc.) with the new tenant model before deployment

## Alternative Approaches

1. **Gradual Migration**: Keep both team and tenant concepts temporarily and migrate gradually rather than a complete replacement. This reduces risk but increases complexity.

2. **Parallel Implementation**: Build the tenant system alongside the existing team system and provide a migration path for users. This allows for more thorough testing but requires maintaining two systems.

3. **Feature Flagging**: Implement the tenant system behind feature flags, allowing gradual rollout and easy rollback if issues arise.

4. **Hybrid Model**: Maintain some team self-service features for certain user roles while restricting others, creating a balanced approach between the current model and the desired centralized administration.

5. **Microservices Approach**: Extract tenant management into a separate microservice, allowing for more focused development and independent scaling of the tenant management system.
